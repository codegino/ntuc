# Frontend Application Challenge

> NOTE: I intentionally did not use any standard for styling. I'm trying to show that I can work with different approach.

> I only created basic tests since `100%` coverage will be time consuming. If testing `rest endpoints` is need, we can use `msw`.

> UI is not color and pixel perfect for the same reason as above
